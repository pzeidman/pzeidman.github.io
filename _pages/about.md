I am Chair of the Methods Group at the [Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging at UCL](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/). In particular, I develop Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM), a framework for investigating the function and circuitry of the human brain. I use this and other statistical methods to investigate vision and memory, particularly how these change due to neurological disorders.

## Methods development
I am a developer of [SPM](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/), the open source software package for analysing neuroimaging data. In particular, I work on DCM for fMRI, a technology which lets people investigate brain circuitry.

## Cognitive neuroscience
My neurobiological interest is how the brain constructs a model of the world and how this changes as we age. In particular, I am interested in the functional anatomy of the hippocampus - a brain structure critical for memory and imagination, which declines early in the progression of Alzheimer's disease. See selected [Publications](/publications).
