I lead the Neurovascular Modelling Group at the [Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging at UCL](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/). We research how the brain and its blood supply change as we age. 

I am also Chair of the Methods Group. We develop statistical methods for analysing neuroimaging data, and make them available via the open source software package [SPM](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/). My technical interests focus on Bayesian analysis methods, particularly Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM), a framework for investigating the function and circuitry of the human brain.

See my selected [Publications](/publications) to read more.
