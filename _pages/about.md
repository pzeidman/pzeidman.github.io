I am a Senior Research Fellow at the Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging at UCL. I develop methods for investigating the function and circuitry of the human brain, and I apply these methods to investigate the common mechanisms underlying vision, memory and imagination.

## Methods development
I am a developer of SPM, the open source software package for analysing neuroimaging data. In particular, I work on Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) for fMRI, a technology which lets people investigate brain circuitry. I am situated in the Methods Group, headed by Professor Karl Friston.

## Neurobiology
My neurobiological interest is how the brain constructs a model of the world based on what we see. In particular, I am interested in the functional anatomy of the hippocampus - a brain structure critical for memory and imagination.

## Current team:
* Dr. Amirhossein Jafarian - Post-doctoral research fellow
* Matilda Morris-Jones - MSc student
