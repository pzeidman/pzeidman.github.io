I am a Senior Research Fellow at the Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging at UCL. I develop methods for investigating the function and circuitry of the human brain, and I apply these methods to investigate the common mechanisms underlying vision, memory and imagination.

## Methods development
I am a developer of SPM, the open source software package for analysing neuroimaging data. In particular, I work on Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) for fMRI, which lets people test hypotheses about brain circuitry using neuroimaging data. I am situated in the Methods Group, headed by Professor Karl Friston.

## Neurobiology
My neurobiological interest is how the brain constructs a model of the world based on visual information.
