I am a Senior Research Fellow at the Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging at UCL. I develop methods for investigating the function and circuitry of the human brain, and I apply these methods to investigate the common mechanisms underlying vision, memory and imagination.

## Methods development
I am developer of SPM, the open source software package for analysing neuroimaging data. In particular, I work on Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) for fMRI. This framework enables people to test hypotheses about brain circuitry using neuroimaging data.

## Neurobiology
My neurobiological interest is how the brain constructs a model of the world based on visual information.
