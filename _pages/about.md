I lead the [Neurovascular Modelling Group](https://nvmgroup.uk/) at the [Functional Imaging Laboratory at UCL](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/). We research how the brain and its blood supply change as we age, using mathematical modelling and non-invasive measures of brain function. This work is funded by an MRC Career Development Award.

I am also Chair of the Methods Group. We develop statistical methods for analysing neuroimaging data, and make them available via the open source software package [SPM](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/). My technical interests focus on Bayesian analysis methods and dynamical systems, particularly Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM), which is a framework for investigating the function and circuitry of the human brain.
