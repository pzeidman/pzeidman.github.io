I teach neuroimaging methods, in particular on the 
[MSc Advanced Neuroimaging](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/taught-degrees/advanced-neuroimaging-msc) course  
and the bi-annual [SPM Courses](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/course/london/) in London.

For other SPM-related technical queries, please join the [SPM Mailing List](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=spm), 
which is monitored by my colleagues in the Methods Group and I.
